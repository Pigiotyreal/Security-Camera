A security camera script I made in python

----IMPORTANT!!!----
Required libaries
pip install -U opencv-python, pip install -U time, pip install -U datetime,

This script when a camera is connected to the computer, can detect movement and faces, I recommend putting this file in a folder because once it detecs a person it records with the camera and saves a mp4. The recording stops 10 seconds after it captures no faces/movement.
